# football_data_eda
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of football players and matches. The goal was to focus on data exploratory data analysis and SQL queries. Uncover insights and patterns within the data. As a bonus task, for the first time, I tried to collect the data for modelling and running a Logistic Regression.
