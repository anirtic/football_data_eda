# football_data_eda
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of football players and matches. The goal was to focus on data exploratory data analysis and SQL queries. Uncover insights and patterns within the data. As a bonus task, for the first time, I tried to collect the data for modelling and running a Logistic Regression.

## Main EDA findings
1. During the early years 2008-2012, we can see that there was quite high correlation between home advantage and the number of goals scored per game. However, this correlation decreases together with decreasing home advantage over the years.

2. The highest number of buildup statistics can be seen in England and Scotland countries football leagues, which could indicate that football matches can be more entertaining to watch if you like fast, with many passes football. While the lowest score is in the Belgium and Netherlands football leagues.

3. Germany Poland and Spain football leagues have the highest Chance creation statistic. These football leagues tend to have a higher quality of created chances. While Belgium has the lowest score.

4. Height between 177-183cm looks like a "dead zone" to football players - on average these players have the lowest potential and overall rating.

5. 75% of players are right-footed, But, by comparing potential and overall rating by preferred foot, there are no significant differences between the players.

6. By comparing the top scorers of each season by league, we can see that in Spain's football league top players outperform the players from other leagues, most of the seasons scoring 40+ goals per season. In the other leagues, the best scorers end up with 20-30 goals on average.

7. 45.9% of football matches wins home_team. There are a similar number of Away_wins matches compared to Tie_Matches (28.7% and 25.4% accordingly).
